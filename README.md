## Credits

This project is part of the ["100 Days of SwiftUI"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by Paul Hudson. I learned how to build this game and further develop my SwiftUI skills through the course.

## Learning Experience

In addition to following the main project instructions, I completed extra challenges provided at the end of the course where there were no instructions.
